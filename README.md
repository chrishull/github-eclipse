Eclipse Editor Sessions tool.

This is code for an eclipse extension that will manage editor tab sessions.  Once installed it appears as a single menu item called "Editor Sessions", just under Revert in the File menu.

For the moment, I'm posting it for code review purposes.  It is feature complete and we're testing it. 

Instructions for use pending.  The user interface is somewhat intuitive.

A little bit about this Eclipse tool

This tool is designed to help developers manage large numbers of files under Eclipse by creating editor sessions.  Basically giving names to groups of open tabs in Eclipse.  You can either snapshot these tab sets (set them so that they do not change so they can be used as a reference), or allow a set to change as files are opened and closed.  You can also alphabetize tabs. The tool even remembers where you were within files on a session by session basis.

This is beta software.  We are testing it now.

Though the plugin has the power to open and close editor windows, it will not destroy your data.  You will always be warned and asked to save data.   Uninstalling the plugin may make your workspace unusable!... so back up your workspace first   ... or just don't uninstall my plugin.  :-)   If you love this product and use it as much as I seem to be doing lately, export the plugin data via the export function.  I promise that all future versions will be able to meaningfully read your data. 

Use this tool.  I think it's useful especially if you work with several assignments within a large workspace or code base.  I, for instance, have several tabs named for JIRA tasks and I can flip between the file sets easily.

For now there are no instructions.  Let's see how intuitive the user interface is.
