# github-eclipse

This is code for an eclipse extension that will manage editor tab sessions.  Once installed it appears as a single menu item called "Editor Sessions", just under Revert in the File menu.

For the moment, I'm posting it for code review purposes.  It is feature complete and we're testing it. 

Instructions for use pending.  The user interface is somewhat intuitive.

Installation instructions.
1: Back up your workspace!
2: In Eclipse, go to Help -> Install new Software.
3: Where it says "Work with", enter this URL...   
http://spillikinaerospace.com/eclipseInstall/
4: Uncheck "Group items by category" or you wan't see anything.
5: Check the box that says Feature.. whatever.
6: Agree to the nonexistent license agreement.
7: Click all the install buttons.

Thanks for playing!  :-)
Share and enjoy;
